#   Note Questions:
# How do you set up pygame?
    # pip install pygame-ce
    # import pygame
    # pygame.init()
    # And everthing else shown above (make the screen, etc.)

# What is the purpose of the "While running" loop?
    # To keep the game going and the screen still running, unless the X button is clicked

# How do you create a screen in pygame?
    # screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))

# How are objects placed on the screen in pygame?
    # pygame.draw.rect(screen, (250,0,0), (x, y, rect_w, rect_h))

# What events can I listen for in pygame? What do those events do?
    # QUIT, K_LEFT, other keys, etc.
    # They listen for if a button or key is clicked.

# How can I detect collision with pygame?
    # 

# How do you add sounds in pygame?
    # 


# Extra:
    # Origin (0,0) is top left, y axis goes down (positive still), x axis goes right
