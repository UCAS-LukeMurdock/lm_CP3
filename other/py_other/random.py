# RANDOM NOTES

    # polymorphism: (parent and child connections?)
        # Every shape has an area so shape should have an area method but we just don't know the exact calculation (placeholder)

    # (Polymorphism is the ability of a single entity, such as a code or an organism, to exist in multiple forms)
